# Navier-Stokes-Equaion-MATLAB
This is a matlab code to obtain an analytical solution to a 1D setady state navier stokes equation
It also compares the analytical solution to the ones obtained from Commercial CFD Software packages like ANSYS Fluent. 
The results have been discussed in the pdf repoft which was submitted as an assignment for Module 1 of the course MSc CFD - Cranfield University.
The Overall grade ontained for this project was 66/100.
